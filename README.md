# health_wellness_classification

This repository contains 2 files:
- MSDSTextClassification_KTrain_bert.ipynb
- MSDSTextClassification_KTrain_distilbert.ipynb

Both notebooks classify the health and wellness news articles using either bert or distilbert classification models.

Please note that I did not use Google Colab as that did not work well for me. I preferred regular Jupyter Notebook. It shoudld not matter which software was used as intention of the project was to perform classification. I split the models into two separate notebooks (for bert and distilbert) as that allowed me to understand each model better and see what changes I needed to make.
